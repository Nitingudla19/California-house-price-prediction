Summary paragraph
In this project, we developed a linear regression model to predict housing prices in California using the California Housing dataset. 
We began with exploratory data analysis (EDA), which helped us identify key relationships—especially the strong correlation between median income and house value.
Several models were trained using different combinations of features, and their performance was evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score.
Among the tested sets, the model using features like median_income, housing_median_age, total_rooms, population, latitude, and longitude achieved the highest R² 
score of approximately 0.64. This suggests a reasonably good fit given the simplicity of linear regression. 

To further improve predictions, more advanced models could be explored, and better handling of categorical features like ocean_proximity would likely enhance performance.
